# real-estate-and-venue-analysis-delhi
It is a clustering analysis project on Real Estate prices and venues of Delhi. In this project, I clustered different areas of Delhi into different groups based on the amenities present in an area and real estate prices. The aim of this project is to help new people settle in Delhi. Whether someone wants to buy a house in Delhi or open a new restaurent, this project will come in handy.
